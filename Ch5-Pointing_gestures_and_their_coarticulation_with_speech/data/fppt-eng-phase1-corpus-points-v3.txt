Okay, I will start.
Okay.
This is the story in all these pictures.
It starts with a man and a woman.
And they are husband and wife.
Here.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down And they are gathering some vegetable PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down in the garden together PGE.
And then they walk back to their house with their PGB-index-contact-complex-down gathered vegetable.
There is PGE one in the basket and their arms.
PGB-other-contact-complex-up And their bring their child their son PGE with them.
And everything is happy.
PGB-palm-contact-simple-down And then PGE.
Later on the man decides to go and have a drink with some other guys. 
They sit around and laugh, and talk, and drink, and drink, and drink.
Can you?
Right.
Words to that effect.
Why do not PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down you hold it PGE?
Cause it is next to you.
Uhm, and so the police are called.
And while the woman sits on the ground and comforts her child and comforts herslef, the police drag the man away.
And put him in handcuffs first.
And then drag him away.
And then later on he is there in court.
They go to court.
And the judge and the court stuff listen to the woman explain what happened.
And she explains how he punched her in the side of the face.
And while she is explaining what happened the man sits quietly in the corner.
And his head in his hands.
And he thinkns PGB-index-nocontact-simple-up in the next picture PGE about what might happen to him.
About how he will probably go to jail.
And how if he is in jail he might be beaten himself by the prison guards.
And he is very worried and anxious about this.
That his wife will be happy to see him, and his son will run to him with open arms.
And so he starts to PGB-palm-contact-complex-down his journey home PGE.
And when he gets home noone is happy to see him.
His wife just stands abd looks at him.
The old man sits and looks at him.
And his son does not run to him with open arms.
But stands looking sad or maybe even afraid holding his bucket of water.
And then he sees that this was not the homecoming that he thought it would be.
And he has some work to do to re-establish the relationship.
So he sits down with his wife and his son.
And he tells them about how while he was in prison he prayed a lot and he reflected on his behavior.
And eventually he had some realizations about himself.
And in particular that he shouldn't drink anymore.
And so later on, the next time he is offered alcohol by the other guys in the area he refuses it.
And his son sees him refusing it.
The end.
Okay.
And then things get ugly.
Because one of the men explains that he is seen his wife flirting with someone.
And yeah, and then he hears this and he is not happy about it.
So then he comes and says: "What is this I hear about you flirting with men?"
And she says: "It did not happen like that at all, I was buying something from him at the market".
And then he says.
And in the background is perhaprs the grandfather of one of them or the father.
And he says: "Right, I am gonna punch you in the face."
Well, he does not say that, but that is.
I have had it.
Say.
Words to that effect probably were exchanged.
And he is still holding his beer and he.
And punches her in the face.
And the baby that she is carrying falls down.
So.
Okay, you wanna do this?
So sure enough, he gets convicted.
And he ends up in jail.
So here he is giving his ordinary civilian clothes to the guard.
And he is in his striped prison outfit.
PGB-palm-contact-simple-down Then, he is in PGE his cell and he is all sad and huddled.
And it is dark.
And there is a little window.
And all he has got is a little loaf of bread or something.
And he sits in there.
PGB-palm-contact-simple-down Here wondering PGE, imagining this joyfull homecoming when he gets out of jail.
Yeah.
PGB-palm-contact-simple-down And then finally he is out of jail.
And he is PGE PGB-palm-contact-simple-down in his clothes PGE, his ordinary clothes again.
And he is PGB-palm-contact-complex-down enjoying the feeling PGE.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yeah to me it looks like a family.
Uhm probably living in an island.
No I see PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-up the same PGE thing.
I feel that uhm yeah both are--
I PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-up guess the mom PGE and the other little kid are not so happy about whatever happened.
PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down But uhm PGE PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down this other person who is coming into the picture he looks pretty PGE happy to talk to them about something I suppose.
I would think that it is maybe a hut of some sort.
Uhm I am not really sure if it would count as a house but.
Yeah yeah.
Is she holding bread.
Or is that a.
Corn.
Yeah I feel.
Yeah.
Okay.
Is that a police officer.
Is that what I am getting.
Yeah.
No exactly it makes me feel like he is coming into or getting out of a prison.
And.
Yeah to me it actually looks like he is happy.
Getting his belongings back.
Yeah.
I hope it is yeah.
That is what it makes me feel.
He has this positive look on him.
And he is getting his stuff back.
And probably getting out of wherever he is.
That is it.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
No exactly yeah.
After seeing the last picture I think that this is like the night before even.
You know.
He went to prison and.
Yeah.
Looks like he is trying to get some sleep.
Does not look comfortable and he.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It also makes me feel like he is very upset at something.
Because there is food on the ground and he is not even touching it you know.
So yeah.
Uhhuh.
Okay.
So this seems like there is a lot of friends together.
Getting together for a drink.
And talk.
Yeah and definitely.
Yeah exactly flirting with another man.
Yeah yeah.
Well yeah I am getting the same picture.
Yeah.
I think he is really upset because I think he is very jealous at this PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-vertical whole PGE situation.
Probably cause they are there.
Yeah.
Oh god okay.
So what I am guessing happened in this picture is that PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-vertical the man PGE I guess hit his wife.
And.
Yeah now PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down they are interrogating him PGE.
He has PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down got this chain on his leg PGE.
Uhhuh.
Yeah I do not know that would make me really uncomfortable to be honest.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right now I think PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down he is PGE obviously very upset and sad.
Uhm while hearing everything that is happening around him.
Yeah that possible yeah.
Uhm.
Yeah.
Uhm.
Is he the PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down same guy PGE from before though like the PGB-other-nocontact-complex-down same people PGE?
Or am I just putting.
Uhhuh.
I am just making this whole story now in my head.
Yeah.
So obviously a happy family.
On the road.
Uhhuh.
Either they are walking out or PGB-index-nocontact-simple-up into some sort PGE of market.
PGB-index-contact-simple-up This guy PGE is probably selling food vegetables.
Yeah.
Okay.
So now I am thinking that this is PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down the same guy PGE.
And he goes often with his friends to drink.
That is what I am thinking.
Yeah.
They seem to be having fun.
There is about seven beers on the ground already.
Yeah.
But it is I think the PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical same group of people that PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical that is the same guy right PGE is telling PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-vertical the other about PGE the wife.
I think I am just making this whole story up.
Are they picking up trash.
Or is that food.
I mean.
They are there.
I did not mean to say that I just.
I just really can not tell if it is yeah their vegetables or their.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical This PGE.
Uhhuh.
So maybe just yeah.
So maybe they are just harvesting.
To take some food back home to eat.
Or to sell.
Good.
Okay.
Uhm yes.
Well.
Yeah.
I mean.
If we are connecting the dots than yeah this would be the moment when he got stopped.
He got detained for hitting her.
And that is after they tell you know she is telling the whole story to them.
Well yeah this is definitely after he came back home from being with his friends and drinking.
Yeah.
I do not think so.
I think he PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down actually has a little PGE bruise too.
I know.
that is just upsetting.
So I think it is a story after all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Oh yeah.
I have not noticed that.
Maybe.
Yeah I just noticed I do not know his face is like you can tell he is full of anxiety.
Yeah yeah.
Ok.
Uhm.
So this might be like a little bit of a stretch but I think is much after of whatever happened.
Cause PGB-other-nocontact-complex-down the kid is already a bit older PGE.
If that is PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-vertical the same PGE kid.
And now PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical he is PGE telling his friends that he does not want to drink anymore.
Because probably I do not know I am making this whole thing in my mind here.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Yeah exactly.
You can PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical obviously see like the face of disapproval of the PGE child.
He is also very like.
Yeah.
Exactly.
To me they even yeah.
Probably I mean that is what I am getting too.
Yeah.
No it is not.
Good for him for saying no though.
So PGB-other-nocontact-complex-down this must be the moment PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down that it actually happened PGE.
Cause you can PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical see he is holding some PGE sort of drink in his hand.
And I guess the bruise that the child had PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down in the previous picture was.
Yeah PGE.
I think it is just an older man who noticed everything happening.
Exactly.
Right.
Yeah.
Exactly.
So I think this old man saw everything happening.
And called someone for help.
Yeah.
The guy on the way.
Uhm.
So I guess here what I am getting is that this is much later.
Cause PGB-index-nocontact-simple-up again that kid is there.
He is much older PGE now.
And I think he is just talking about his experience while he was in jail.
Yeah no I actually think that that is a moment of reflection you know.
Like he is reflecting on everything he did.
And yeah not to do that again.
Yeah and PGB obviously saying PGE or telling them about how horrible everything was in there.
That is what I am getting very uncomfortable hitting cells dark corner I do not know. 
Uhm.
I think this must be way later.
Once he I do not to me it makes me feel like he finally realized that he should not be doing the things he did in the past.
That now he is much happier.
Yes.
Right that is what I thought too.
So it might be either before or way after.
But yeah it makes me feel like this is way before everything happened.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just I guess I just did not realize that that was the reason behind why he did what he did you know.
Like now to me it makes sense.
He is very jealous.
He is drunk.
Yeah.
Definitely overreacting about this whole thing.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Oh.
Yeah it is the same scene yeah.
So I guess PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical the old man is someone is you know PGE like they are related right.
Because PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical it was an old man sitting in the PGE.
And that is probably why yeah exactly.
He was so happy to be back home.
You know after being in prison for so long.
And that why PGB-index-nocontact-simple-up they PGE were so upset at him coming back I guess.
Wow.
So it was a story.
Yeah.
Uhm.
Yeah I think so too.
So let us see.
Yeah.
That is just there in the middle.
This is definitely after right?
This is.
That is just after yeah.
Uhhuh.
This here happens somewhere in between here.
Between these two.
Probably.
Exactly that is what I think too.
let us put it here.
Uhm.
They were probably PGB-index-nocontact-complex-up drinking PGE after work that is what I am thinking.
That would be yeah much earlier.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down They are picking up stuff PGE.
Also like this so.
Let us put it together.
Yeah.
No yeah that would actually make sense.
Yes.
No no I agree.
I think that yeah he is PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-vertical definitely PGE just listening PGB-index-nocontact-complex-vertical hearing the PGE whole story.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-up And now he is just having all PGE these crazy thoughts in his head.
What would happen.
Uhm.
Uhhuh probably.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yeah I think.
Should be like that.
And then he is coming out.
Far at the end.
This would be the first picture we saw.
Right after he comes out and goes home.
Yeah.
Let us put it there.
So what I thinking is that PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down that is very early in the morning PGE.
He got dressed he got out of the house.
He is enjoying some sun.
He is PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down on his way to work PGE.
Or that is what I am thinking.
Or PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical maybe that is PGE but wait.
That is exactly what I was looking at yeah.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down Look at that shirt PGE.
Yeah.
I have not realized but yeah.
I think so too.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-vertical Would be PGE the first ones.
So.
Exactly.
That is what I am thinking.
So PGB-palm-contact-complex-up they were PGE harvesting or collecting food.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical Went to PGE the market sold everything.
PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-vertical Went for PGE drinks.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think we have got it.
Looks like people waiting PGB-index-contact-simple-down for this boy PGE to come back.
So I am thinking PGB-index-contact-complex-down maybe that is PGE parents PGB-index-contact-simple-down and PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down Little brother PGE is it.
Yeah.
They look quite cross.
I can not quite PGB-index-contact-simple-down see on the PGE dad is PGB-index-contact-simple-down face PGE but PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down the mom and the PGE boy look quite sad or angry do not they.
Unless I am just reading in.
Yeah.
What PGB-index-contact-complex-down is this thing is it a house PGE or PGB-index-contact-simple-down is it a PGE.
I PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down can not really tell what PGE do you think it is.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
And I can not really see looks PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down like maybe PGE PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down there is a wall but PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down you do not PGE can not really see. 
It looks like maybe corn or something.
So like PGB-index-contact-complex-down these two look like they have been busy at work PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Not sure about him PGE.
And maybe PGB-index-contact-simple-down he was meant PGE to be and he went somewhere else.
Not sure.
Yeah looks that way.
can not tell if he is getting or taking the clothes.
Yeah.
That the PGB-index-contact-complex-down man in the PGE torn clothes he does not have like a sad face.
He is just got sort of a neutral positive face on.
Yeah.
So yeah maybe he maybe he is getting them back.
I hope so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe all around.
So the way that it is that he is got food on the floor makes me think that it is is something like prison.
And not just his house or something.
Like he is not just in poverty.
I think that he is a prisoner.
Yeah maybe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He might be like hugging himself for like a bit of reassurance on this.
He is really lonely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
that is true.
And his clothes is being all torn up.
Makes you wonder what had happened to him.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
It looks like PGB-index-contact-simple-down he PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down is telling his friend PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down about something he saw PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down I am thinking PGE that PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down that lady PGE is PGB-index-contact-simple-down his PGE girlfriend.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down And this guy PGE PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down observed his friend girlfriend stroking some man arm PGE.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it is PGB-index-contact-complex-down making him PGE cross and angry.
And PGB-index-contact-complex-down he is definitely PGE PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down acting like he should be PGE angry with the finger pointing and all,
Oh yeah.
She is she is terrible.
Yeah.
I mean especially if they have had a drink they are probably getting unreasonably cross about whatever they saw.
Yeah.
Uhm.
Yeah.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down I do not know if these two PGE have gotten into PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down this conversation PGE or PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-vertical they are just PGE there.
They probably just there.
Yep.
Uh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And she is recounting her side of the story.
I feel like would you really have the victim in the same room as the uhm.
Yeah.
And she happened to be honest so.
Good on her for being honest.
Maybe he is putting it into perspective and not thinking about himself like for the PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down first time PGE in this situation.
Yeah.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down These three are not even looking PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down at him PGE.
I mean that is a lot of trust that they can leave him there.
But maybe he is tied to that chair in some way.
Uhm.
Looks like a nice scene like a happy family.
Well PGB-index-contact-complex-down I am sure that is the same PGE skirt.
That is the lady so it could be.
There is a lot going on.
Yeah.
Looks happy.
She PGB-index-contact-simple-down he is doing their work carrying the thing PGE.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down She is looking after the child PGE.
Yeah.
Yeah.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down The thing that might be corn PGE or might not be.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Uhm.
Yeah.
It just looks like a group of friends is having a laugh and a drink.
Nice.
Oh yeah.
Ah there.
I can not.
I can not remember what he looked like.
You have got better memory than me.
That is very rude about their food.
Yeah.
Looks like food.
What is that trash you are cooking.
Yeah it looks like food to me.
Yeah oh kind of looks like leaves.
So that could be leaves but I think it is food.
I think it is probably food.
I do not know.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Or to sell I guess.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
So this must be.
Well if it is all one connected story than this is right when he hits her.
Maybe he has come home PGB-index-contact-simple-down and drunk PGE and with a bottle.
That is what it looks like kind of.
And he is being taken away.
She is protecting her child.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is what it makes me think yeah.
Is the child ok.
Oh my god.
Uhm.
Yeah that is horrible.
Aha.
Yeah.
Just in a different order.
So he is obviously thinking about what is going to happen to him.
Maybe he is in like a police car or waiting for or waiting for something.
Cause he does not look that disheveled yet.
But he has PGB-index-contact-complex-down got the handcuffs PGE on so.
Yeah so he is thinking about what is going to happen to him.
He can get beaten and locked up.
Yeah.
But probably not not like worn down by it yet.
So I do not think it has happened yet.
Yeah.
Oh.
Uhm.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah I think.
Cause I PGB-index-contact-complex-down I could not understand PGE who the child was.
I was thinking I PGB-index-contact-complex-down thought it was on the night PGE that it PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down happened PGE and he was saying Oh no I should not drink anymore.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down But then I could not understand PGE who the child was.
But PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical yeah it is PGE probably the future and his child is older.
And he is saying No no I am not going to drink cause I will do stupid things again.
Yeah.
He probably knows about.
Might even have been told about it.
Uhm.
And his friends look a bit older too do not they.
If they are the same friends.
They have got.
Lines on their foreheads and things.
Maybe they have just been wasting their lives drinking since his.
I was PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down gonna say PGE as well because it is not like in a bar or a house.
It is just outside in a you know on a bench.
So that might be fine when you are a bit younger but when you are old and you are drinking on a bench that is.
That is not great is it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical Looks PGE like the baby might even fall.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Who is this though PGE.
Who probably went to the police also.
I was wondering how the police got there so quickly.
When she was still like on the floor.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Gosh.
Looks that way.
He is older.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is that PGB-index-contact-complex-down him like seeing the light or PGE something.
I do not know that could be a stretch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He looks quite proud of himself.
But then it that looks like the picture from the very beginning with PGB-index-contact-complex-down him with the things PGE strapped on his back.
Yeah yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yeah maybe way after this it is gonna be like this.
Yeah.
Uhm.
Oh no.
I mean.
I totally knew that he was gonna be overreacting.
But.
He really was.
So she is just explaining her side of the things.
That she was just handing the man the money.
She was not flirting with him.
He is obviously not listening to reason.
Cause he has had a lot to drink.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So he is dreaming from his prison cell of what how it will be when he comes home.
But maybe that that first picture where everyone looks angry at him is more accurate.
Cause that is like PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down the scene is not it PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down And the there was the man PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down and the wife PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down and the boy PGE.
Yeah it could have been yeah.
Like her mother or something.
Her father Her mother.
PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-up Or something PGE and then.
So PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-vertical he is dreaming PGE that his son will come running at him.
But we actually know that he actually stands there looking disapproving.
Yeah.
That is right.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think we have got a good idea there.
So uhm.
I will just put that like here and we can go like before or after I guess.
That is probably earlier.
I am PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-vertical still not sure PGE about that one.
Yeah so that is when he is coming explaining.
So that is going to quite near the end.
Maybe at the end.
That is PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down just PGE after.
That is sometime near the end.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down that is I think that is PGE gonna be there.
I am not sure about that one.
Yeah that is PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical early before PGE.
Yeah.
I am not sure.
Yeah similar to this one.
Ah PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down maybe this PGE is in here.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down Because the PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down I mean PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-vertical So he has gone to this PGE jury and.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical Now he is waiting to PGE see what is going to happen to him.
Do you think.
Yeah.
that is PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical just PGE after they started drinking maybe.
I think so.
Uhm.
Though.
Maybe just before PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down this PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down So this is his like PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down hope to get through PGE.
Maybe.
Yeah.
It is PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical him coming PGE out.
So I think that is when he comes out.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Just here PGE.
So it is just those three.
Uhm.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Could be.
I am just looking at their clothes.
I think he has got PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down I think these PGE his clothes from the end.
So maybe that is like the final picture.
So.
Put it there.
Maybe PGB-palm-contact-complex-down when you know PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down he is proud of PGE himself because PGB-palm-contact-complex-up he has rejected PGE alcohol and getting his life back on track.
So it seems.
And PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down these PGE ones.
Yeah the first ones where they are still a happy family.
And then maybe it is after hot days when he is going for drinks in the shadow on those two pictures.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then that is when it all went down yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It looks like a village.
Or some sort of hood and a and a tourist.
That is true.
That is true I just thought it was a backpack but it is not.
And they are carrying planting or bananas or something.
Uhhuh.
They are working.
Well apart from the older man he does not seem to be working.
That is carrying water.
The firewood the wood prepared.
Yeah.
I guess That is.
No.
Looks like palm trees in the background.
Seems to be on like sort of sandy surface.
Yeah.
It looks like that yeah.
He seems happy.
That is true.
Yeah.
It seems that on both sides actually there is barrier than wires.
Kind of interesting to.
Is he coming from outside or is he being released or is he entering I can not.
Entering the prison where he is going to be.
In some respect resp desperate for.
Yes.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Well I mean PGE yeah yeah yeah true.
Yeah.
Both male.
Oh.
That is true.
Yeah.
This is a guy who looks like he is in prison.
This could be the guy we.
No sunshine.
Well one one window with bars in it so.
No sunlight.
A lot of flies flying around.
And he is really wearing rugs.
Uhhuh.
Yep.
Break away from the.
They seem to be drinking.
They seem to be talking about some interaction with a woman.
And pointing at.
I do not know what to make of that.
Yeah.
They are angry.
They seem.
Angry and they seem to be discussing interaction between a man and a woman who.
That is true.
That is true.
But the guy.
I mean maybe he is saying hey your girlfriend or partner I saw her flirting with some guy.
Because the man in the speech bubble does not appear to be one of them.
In the discussion.
Uhhuh.
And they seem to be drinking liqueur rather than beer.
I do not know Red Stripe.
Oh okay.
Uhhuh.
Okay.
Uh.
By the guy who has been drinking beer in the previous pictures.
Who is now sitting oh he has got a he has got a ball and chain on his ankle.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They certainty seem to be older Well one The main That is definitely that the officials seem to be older.
And they seem to be looking very sympathetically at the woman understandably.
It is the same guy wearing flipflops the whole time.
I am wondering if That is indicator that That is the same guy or.
The whole time right.
Yeah.
It seems like the type of architectural style that we saw on the first image of the family.
Yeah.
They are all wearing shoes.
Uhm.
Uhm this looks like the past.
It is the same woman she is wearing the same shoes the same skirt.
She looks happy she is not injured.
They have a baby.
Yeah.
I am not sure what they are yeah.
Walking along the pathway and they seem happy.
It is not clear whether this is before or after.
I am assuming I am assuming that he went to prison after beating her.
And this is in the past.
Yeah.
Yep.
The guy in the stripy t-shirt have been informing him right there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah there does not seem to be any aggression this time.
They seem there is five instead of four people and.
And they are sitting outside.
And they seem much more relaxed.
What seems like guys with long hair as opposed to women is just just man.
Yeah looks like pumpkins though right.
I am not sure those are pumpkins in the background.
Coconut trees.
It looks like they are coconuts.
Yeah.
They are working together.
Farming.
Yeah.
It seems peaceful.
And no issues to speak of.
Uh.
Yep.
He is being dragged away by the police.
Both mother and the child appear to have a black eye.
He looks remorseful.
For what That is worth.
And he is already in handcuffs.
This is like yeah.
Probably the image that would fit right after the image where they had this could be court case.
I think.
Yeah.
I think so yeah.
Yeah.
does not seem like he has arrived at prison yet at least.
And he is wearing the same clothes he is always been wearing.
He is obviously worrying.
Ah this is the same guys drinking.
But now they seem to be having some sort of disagreement.
Looks like if it his son his son has got a lot older.
He was an infant earlier and now he looks like a child.
Yeah but they just seem like sort of drunken haggard men trying to as you said goad him into joining them.
And he looks angry.
He has just punched his partner while she is holding their child.
And an old man is watching them in the background.
Yeah.
Yep it seems to sum it up nicely.
Looks like their child is about to fall.
Yeah.
Looks like he is speaking of his time in prison. 
To his partner and child.
Child no longer infant.
So he seems to be saying speaking of what he has suffered in prison.
And that he now wants to repent sort of.
That is how I would interpret it.
Yeah.
They are just watching him.
And both look concerned.
Uhhuh.
Enjoying his freedom.
Bathing of of his face in the sun.
Uhhuh.
Aha.
This is prior to the beating.
Uhhuh.
And he obviously he is reporting that he has heard that she was flirting with this man.
And she is saying no I was merely paying him for whatever.
Vegetables are in her back in that image.
And the old man in the back is witnessing this.
She looks terrified.
And the child looks terrified too.
He just looks enraged but yeah.
He has got a beer in his hand.
Ah.
Yeah.
He looks calm and I would say.
He is imagining a joyous reunion with his family assuming that his partner and child are going to be happy to see him.
And That is definitely the same hut that we saw in the first image.
uhm.
Yeah.
Dreaming.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah I do not think this should be too.
Yeah.
No we can say this is definitely earlier.
The child is still a child.
They.
They fit together very nicely.
Exactly.
This one.
Pardon.
He definitely does get out.
I would say that PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-down that.
I mean PGE PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down this PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down the actually beating itself definitely happened while the kid was a child PGE.
He does get out of prison.
What is not clear is whether he manages to redeem himself in the eyes of the family.
Yeah I think so.
I would PGB-index-contact-complex-down say that would be when he is getting released PGE.
I would say that comes right after.
Yes so in there.
This probably somewhere around here.
This while he is still in prison.
This is when he returns from.
That is it.
You can also see while he is PGB-index-contact-complex-down wearing PGE.
He does manage PGB-palm-contact-simple-vertical to have some relationship with his child obviously PGE.
Because PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down he is wearing his PGE out of prison clothes.
And.
Yeah.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down This looks like PGE before I would say.
Yeah.
And this is somewhere at the very end I would say.
Yeah.
Uhm.
I am not sure if he or it could be a tourist.
He could also be native cause he seems like he is dressed pretty pretty appropriately from PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down the other people PGE.
Yep.
Uhhuh.
Yep some kind of fruit or vegetable.
And ironically the could-be-tourist guy who is approaching them seems very upbeat and happy but the the rest of the people in the picture seem to be pretty down.
Yep.
The resources gathered.
Eh only I guess PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down yeah PGE the PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down the female PGE PGB-other-nocontact-complex-down the woman and the guy who is PGE walking up have sandals but I can not imagine they have any discernible distinction.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
This looks like a guy coming to a prison camp maybe.
So some kind of official.
He is discussing the details of his package of clothing.
I guess he is maybe either getting released or something like that because.
He is.
Yeah.
And he is dressed very terribly.
But he is going to get something clean to wear.
I think it is similar type of nation.
Except for this place has a little bit has imported barbed wire and steal fences.
Uhm.
Well.
It is hard to discern exactly.
But he is on the PGB-other-contact-simple-down side of the interior PGE.
Right PGB-other-contact-complex-down going toward PGE actually.
Yes.
Yep.
Uhhuh.
I think he is being released actually cause PGB-other-contact-simple-down he is much paler PGE PGB-other-contact-simple-down than the guard PGE.
Seems like he has been inside a while.
What else.
Oh.
Well.
Yeah this seems like a progression.
Let us see.
Eh a very sad looking moldy potato for dinner.
Yeah.
Yeah it is tiny too.
No.
Yeah does not look comfortable either.
There might be PGB-other-nocontact-complex-down either PGE you PGB-other-contact-simple-down know another blanket in the corner PGE or he is PGB-other-contact-simple-down sitting on PGE the only means of comfort in his cell.
And looks very isolated depressed.
Uhhuh.
Yeah indeed.
They are discussing.
Yep.
Yeah it is a typical guys hanging out outside and getting drunk in summer time.
But.
Uhhuh.
I do not know either.
We they have a body a lot of body language in their culture.
That is very clear.
Looks like the same kind of it could be the same kind of like people from the previous ones.
And.
Yeah.
Which might be a PGB-other-nocontact-complex-down bit of flirting PGE right.
Cause her arm her her arm is on his arm.
They seem like happy.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
It could Well or it could be a kind of Red Stripe.
Yeah.
Okay.
They are beer in those bottles.
Yeah.
Oh Jesus.
Well this is the natural progression I guess.
So seems like she this woman got punched for her flirtatious actions.
Yeah.
Ball and chain.
He is essentially so this looks like some kind of court interaction.
Primitive court interaction right.
Cause we are limited to I guess the the testimonies PGB-other-nocontact-complex-down of these two parties PGE.
Who are PGB-other-nocontact-simple-down clearly the ones PGE involved in the punching situation.
And perhaps their lawyer and some kind of official.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Yeah she really got punched hard Jeez.
Uhhuh.
Could be.
Also the building looks way underdeveloped for what it is being used for.
Uhhuh.
Yep.
Continuing the theme of like them gathering some resources of some variety.
Picking up some weird fruits.
Yep.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
And there is another extra in the PGB-index-contact-simple-down picture PGE.
Punching the cart I guess or something.
That is about it.
Ah.
So the it seems like there is those people drink from earlier it could have been this guy is friends as well.
Yep.
And plenty of beer this time.
And this time the the previous guy who may have been the prisoner has also joined right.
And they are drinking significantly more.
They all seem happy actually.
It happens I promise it does.
Looks like the couple from before perhaps.
Working in a field or working on something.
Gathering some cabbages or pumpkins.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
It seems peaceful.
Yep.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
He hit the kid too I guess.
Broke a bottle over her face.
Yep.
Yeah.
And the broken bottle is on the floor.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yep.
Aha.
So this is probably before he actually gets to the prison cell.
And he is kind terrifying himself about what it would be like.
Uhhuh.
It is.
He is beaten in one of his thoughts.
And just imagining the isolation in the other in captivity and it is stressing him out clearly by his facial expression.
Although the backdrop does not really tell you much about where they are.
This could be the building where they were having the court discussion.
Yeah.
But aside from that.
Uh.
Yep.
Okay.
Trying to goad him into.
Could be like joining drinking or smoking.
It looks like it could be a pack of cigarettes in his hand or something.
And it looks like it could be the guy from before walking with his son.
Who neither looks too interested in participating in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yep.
Ah.
The incident itself.
Presumably the old man from the first picture who was sitting on the porch.
He was the witness to this situation.
And yeah.
So it seems like he might have been drinking a bit.
And came and socked his wife in the face.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Yep.
Yep.
Agree.
Yeah.
This looks like he is back at their home.
And he has already begun to kind of try and become I guess a better person.
Sort of in the prison process.
Came back to offer his repentance to his family.
Yeah.
Yeah everyone face in this picture is somewhat concerned I would say yeah.
Oh he is a new man.
Yeah.
Yep.
Presumably the prison is in the background.
He is back on the palm tree island we have come to endure.
Uhm.
Yep.
Immediately I would say.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
His looks strangely like kind of enjoying that he got something on her.
He has kind of this twist in his face.
He looks very vindictive in this picture.
Yeah well.
Okay.
So we are back in prison.
He is imagining the reunion with his family.
Yep.
Uhhuh.
Yep.
I have nothing to add to that.
Except for the fact that yeah it is the same barbed window as before.
So clearly it is the cell.
We were kind of developing it as it went on.
Do you wanna split.
Arrange what is earlier and later maybe.
By the means of the process faster.
Uhhuh.
Yep.
It is the.
Here we go.
Which merits this one.
We do have the opportunity to give this quite a happy ending though.
We have the opportunity to give this quite a happy ending thought.
As that part is not objectively clear.
For example these ones are in--
Okay.
Uhhuh.
This would be here.
Right.
Right.
Agreed.
uhm we missed the step here.
I guess this goes here actually.
Ish.
If PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down we get down PGE.
Oh right yeah-yeah.
Uhhuh.
Well before cause he has the.
So in.
Yep I PGB-index-contact-simple-down guess PGE.
There is nothing else there.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down That is when he actually returns PGE.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Uhm.
True.
These are also pretty ones.
Logic yeah.
He was also better friends with these guys I guess.
And.
Yeah.
If we go by the dress logic.
Can we create space.
And probably he did that before.
They got the pumpkins before they got they had the pumpkins obviously.
Yeah I would agree.
So he kind of gives up drinking I suppose.
So here we have some sort of.
Looks like an island.
Society.
You see the palm trees.
He is PGB-index-contact-simple-down wearing flipflops PGE.
Yeah maybe maybe he does look like a tourist.
Looking for directions from this very happy looking family.
Yeah PGB-index-contact-simple-down he does not seem PGE too happy.
Maybe because PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical he is PGE carrying a heavy bucket I do not know.
Like they are waiting for something I guess.
He is the only happy one of the bunch.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Look at her PGE.
Yeah I think so he is clearly an outsider.
He is coming from a different direction.
Approaching people who are in a much different state than him.
They PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-vertical did not even give him PGE a shirt.
I am not sure.
Maybe adds to the tourist evidence.
What do you PGB-index-contact-simple-down think he is carrying PGE Is that water or milk.
Oh.
I do not see any cows around.
Or goats that might produce milk.
No I think that is good.
But is it the same guy from the other picture.
He is dressed differently.
Anyways.
Maybe PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical he is PGE.
Ah PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down yeah those are the clothes from before PGE.
And PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down he is giving them PGE up to what looks like a police officer.
He is.
Oh that is a good that is a good question.
Yeah and PGB-index-contact-complex-down looks like there is like some barbed wire over here PGE.
He still looks happy though.
He is still in a good mood.
Yeah.
So maybe this is somehow before.
Yeah.
No the same pants the same flipflops.
Maybe.
Cause like PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down he has.
It also has some sort of PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down checkered patterns.
I think PGE it is the same shirt.
It is definitely the same outfit.
But I would say he is he is definitely receiving them.
Ok well not definitely but he is it appears that he is receiving them.
Yeah.
Oh some nice clothes.
Better than the rags he is wearing.
Uhhuh.
I agree.
Next.
The things have deteriorated.
But we still do not know what order is there.
Maybe PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down maybe PGE PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down this family was PGE not at all kind to him.
And PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical that somehow led him PGE to this PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down grim PGE situation.
Although PGB-index-contact-complex-down maybe.
I think you are right because this I think you are right because this.
Yeah PGE.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down This is before because he PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down has dirty PGE clothes on.
Uhm.
I think PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down this is PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down the same outfit PGE as that definitely.
Though.
Yeah.
Yep.
Real dirty.
So maybe.
Okay.
Uhm I think so too.
We are putting the clues together.
Oh well ok PGB-palm-contact-simple-down so I see a bench PGE.
They are sitting on a bench.
Maybe this is.
So PGB-index-contact-simple-down is this our protagonist.
Is that the same guy.
And his clothes were PGE in a better state at that point.
Not as ripped.
He has PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down whole pants PGE.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
About or a woman.
Where are they though.
No.
But are we.
Yeah that could be.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down But is that the guy PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down in the picture PGE.
Is he PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down the same PGE Is he PGB the same PGE Is he PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down the same PGE.
No PGB-index-contact-simple-down he has a beard PGE.
Can not be the same person.
Hmm.
Uhhuh.
Maybe we gonna find out in the next picture.
Yeah.
They did not recycle it no.
This is so not Germany.
So this.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Who is this.
This is his girlfriend PGE.
Uhm.
Is this PGB-index-contact-simple-down already in jail though.
Looks like he is wearing a ball and chains PGE.
Aha yeah yeah.
Okay PGB-index-contact-simple-down yes so she is the witness.
Or the PGE victim.
And they are writing down her testimony.
Oh PGB-index-contact-simple-down and this is him there PGE he is.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down Does he look PGE remorseful.
He has his hand in his face and.
Maybe he feels very ashamed of what he did.
I wonder one would hope.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Is she PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down does she look like this here.
Or PGE do we think that is her.
Yeah.
Maybe this is this PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down predates all of it PGE Maybe this is this PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-down predates all of it PGE.
We keep going.
Maybe a happier memory.
Uhhuh.
Yeah but PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down now we kind of start to understand why PGE they were not so happy here to see him.
Yeah.
But this was obviously before their life.
And before the altercation Carrying.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Still those palm trees.
Oh well yeah.
Yeah.
We are back to the bench.
Back to the drinking.
Maybe it is working up to that.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
So it is not.
It does not seem like it is necessarily like a straight line.
There it goes backwards and then forwards.
Kind of like a movie.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Maybe.
But it PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down does not.
He does not yet seem PGE like aggressive or angry in those pictures.
So maybe this stuff is right PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical before they PGE told him the story.
Uhhuh.
Yes.
Harvesting.
Uhhuh.
Looks like pumpkins or some sort of gourd.
This is what another picture of what his normal daily life could be.
Looks so.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
This is obviously pre.
Pre-incident.
Okay.
So this is.
Oh no.
Uhhuh.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical Obviously PGE.
Both his wife and his kid.
Not good.
Well.
And he is going to jail.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Probably going PGE.
Uhhuh.
Yeah it PGB-index-contact-complex-down still makes me think that this is.
I was just revisiting this.
And this is definitely PGE him getting out of jail I think.
Because he looks much worse for wearing.
You can tell PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down by the state of his clothing PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down that he is PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down going off to his PGE his court date or whatever.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Jail is not fun.
Yeah.
He is probably just thinking about how miserable it is and how the guards beat him.
Yeah.
I think we just have not seen it yet.
Maybe PGB-index-contact-complex-down it happened shortly PGE after this.
Well hopefully.
I can not say personally but.
I would like to believe in the system though.
Yeah.
Overly instinctual.
Oh that hurts.
I want to be free.
I think it will come though.
I think he will.
I am positive that he will have an epiphany.
Oh yeah and he is in he is in his new life outfit.
He is got his patterned shirt and his not dirty pants.
And PGB-index-contact-simple-down do we thing this was his son PGE.
Uhhuh.
He is rejecting his past life his drinking.
But he is.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Yeah I do not know.
I think his son probably does not like his friends.
Who would.
Like look.
That is true.
He he PGB-index-contact-simple-down definitely looked older though than PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down than even here.
Or PGE.
definitely PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical in the PGE the memory picture.
Uhhuh.
I wonder how how much time he spent in jail.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down I would even say it is like right PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down like moments before this PGE picture.
Or.
I do not know.
Right before that.
Uhhuh.
Alcohol seems to be a factor in all this.
Uhhuh.
One yeah one of his friends drunkenly saying I saw your wife talking to this dude.
But who knows.
And that was enough.
Jail was awful.
I had a lot of time to think.
I want to be a family again.
Almost looks like some sore of PGB-other-nocontact-complex-vertical spiritual uhm gesture PGE.
Yeah.
Maybe he is been praying to some god.
And he had his epiphany.
Uhhuh.
definitely looks a bit more pensive.
Unlike some of the other jail pictures.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Aha enjoying the sunshine again.
In August all his jail pictures PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down are very dark PGE.
He only has PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down like a little sliver PGE of light also in here.
Like the sun was something he really missed.
Here.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
PGB-other-contact-complex-down Between these two PGE yeah.
About to go home.
Oh wait.
Yeah the escalation.
That PGB-index-contact-simple-down leads up to PGE this.
Yeah.
She was probably just paying for some groceries.
Yeah he.
He can not see reason from.
Oh yeah.
He said she said.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Baby PGE.
Yeah.
Hopefully he does not remember his dad that way.
Uhhuh.
I wonder if PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down that is PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down his dad or PGE her dad.
Uhhuh.
Uhm.
Maybe we will get more cards.
Oh he misses his family.
Yeah.
Imagining.
Yeah.
Oh.
He got a very different reality.
He had to earn their their trust again.
Uhhuh.
Like PGB-palm-contact-complex-down explaining PGE his thought process.
And remorse.
Very likely.
Yeah.
It seems like jail made him prioritize his family.
And reassess how how negative an impact the friends and drinking had.
He just wants to be with them.
Uhhuh.
That is true.
Uhhuh.
Yeah.
Uhhuh.
Here.
Uh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That is the thing we do not know.
Do we know.
Did he did he reform.
Do we also create like a happily ever after ending.
Uhhuh.
So once upon a time.
Okay that yeah that probably also makes sense.
I think we start with.
Uhhuh.
Oh yeah.
Oh I kind of like that.
Yeah.
So once upon a time there was.
There was a guy working in a field.
Picking pumpkins.
And he met a beautiful princess.
And they had a kid together.
And they were real happy.
But he also had some unsavory PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down friends PGE.
Yeah.
He got into some bad habits.
Drinking and what not.
And littering.
Yeah.
And so he had a bad friend.
That said something that we are assuming was untrue.
But do not actually know.
And he got really angry.
And did some things.
Uhhuh.
He said.
So and so said you were with this guy.
And you touched his arm.
What do you have to say for yourself.
Yeah.
He hit her and presumably also his child.
His own child.
I do not I do not know why.
What the child would have anything to do with that.
Maybe he was just in the way.
Maybe he was crying.
I do not know.
Okay yeah.
So maybe the kid just fell.
Though.
definitely yeah.
Uhhuh.
And then he had a trial.
And.
Uhhuh.
He went to jail.
So what do we think this happened before this.
Uhhuh.
He looks a bit cleaner.
That is true.
Uhhuh.
But this is after he has been home.
So I think this happens next.
He has some transformative time in jail where he reflects on how nice his life was.
He serves his sentence.
He gets his flipflops back.
And he gets out of jail.
And he feels the sunshine on his face.
And he returns to his family who are.
Yes.
They are very apprehensive of his return.
He is gotta take what he can get.
And he tells them about how awful prison was.
And how he had time to think and reflect.
And it seems that they start to accept.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down They are at least PGE listening to him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He PGB-palm-contact-simple-down rejects his old life
His PGE old habits.
And walks off into the distance.
He has to he has to regain the trust of his family.
Probably get back to harvesting pumpkins again.
And he is gonna work towards staying on the straight and narrow.
The end.
Tropical island yeah.
You see the palm trees house on stilts.
Does he look like a tourist I do not know.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-vertical This is a family PGE then.
They can come and help him but yeah.
They seem.
Well PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down the first guy PGE seems very into it.
Seems very friendly.
That is why I said tourist.
He is trying to get directions.
Yeah.
They are putting their poor bout to work too.
I know.
What does PGB-index-contact-simple-down he have on his back though PGE.
Some rucksack with a towel.
I would guess water.
Anything else.
Alright next picture.
Okay.
So here he is getting out of jail.
Aha.
Something is chronologically PGB-index-contact-simple-down before or after then PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Cause he looks PGE a bit worse from where.
Looks like he has been.
Yeah so he looks pretty ragged.
Is he giving them or getting them.
I suppose we just keep going on.
uhm Like I want to say PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down he does look like an official PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down So that is what I say a police officer PGE.
Yeah.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical But is not like.
Like the PGE.
I am thinking aboriginal.
So I was wondering if something happened to him then.
Yeah I do not know cause he is in jail.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down Cause he looks a bit rough PGE so I do not know if he got mugged or something.
I do not know.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical He is obviously telling PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-vertical him PGE PGB-index-nocontact-complex-vertical what he is PGE getting.
He is getting his shoes his shirt and his and a pair of pants.
New pair of pants then.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down The shirt looks like though PGE.
Maybe we are just overanalysing stuff.
Yeah.
He seems happy.
He seems to be happy to get them back.
I do not know.
So I think something happened to him.
Terrible story.
Next.
Okay.
It is getting darker.
It is going the other way around yeah.
I think so PGB-index-contact-simple-down it starts here PGE.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down He is wearing PGE pants here PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down that seem PGE worn off.
He is obviously in jail for some reason or other.
Pretty deplorable state.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down I think we are going this way PGE though.
This is what I am thinking.
We are going back in time.
Should we name him or.
Uhhuh.
They are sitting on a bench drinking.
Yeah I think it is the same guy.
He is PGB-index-contact-simple-down wearing a dark PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down shirt PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down It is consistent PGE until PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down it gets to these PGE ones.
I guess he is with his friends PGB-index-nocontact-complex-vertical in a park PGE they are all drinking something.
PGB-index-contact-simple-vertical He looks angry PGE.
And PGB-index-contact-simple-vertical he is telling him something about PGE I do not know a girl a boy.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down He does not look happy either PGE.
So PGB-index-contact-simple-down it could be his girlfriend PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down talking to somebody else PGE.
No.
I do not know my guess is PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down he is with PGE PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-down his group of friends PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down One of his friends PGE is telling him that he saw his girlfriend somewhere.
But how he goes PGB-index-contact-simple-down from there PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down to here PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down or came from here to there I do not know PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Just does not look very organized.
Or orderly PGE because they do have the bottle on the ground.
This is not Germany then.
Okay.
Aha.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down I think this PGE is PGB-index-contact-simple-down the girl from this that he is PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down the guy in the striped shirt PGE is telling him.
And he PGB-index-contact-simple-down obviously hit him hit her.
And PGE this is his girlfriend or whoever it is.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down She is PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down reporting that to the police PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down This looks like PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down him PGE.
I would guess this might be a trial then.
She PGB-index-contact-simple-down is explaining PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down what is happening.
And they are writing it down PGE.
Victim.
So he is PGB-index-contact-simple-down in PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down trial PGE.
Well.
One would hope.
Or he is selfish only PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down worried about himself PGE.
We do not know PGB-index-contact-complex-down what happens PGE.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down That is why I am curious what is happening here though PGE in the first picture.
He is kind of remorseful repentant.
It could be.
Okay.
Yeah.
So here they are the happy family then yeah.
So this is very early then.
They PGB-index-contact-simple-down have their son PGE.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down I am assuming this might be PGE this boy now.
He is PGB-index-contact-simple-down happy here cause he is PGE getting out of jail.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down But PGE yeah.
They seem like a happy couple.
The baby seems happy.
Seems communicative.
It is warm.
But like Florida though.
Yeah so I think there is but we still need more pictures than that.
Yes can we go there.
Seems like it is their family history.
So I guess PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down might.
I do not know these pictures do not seem to join PGE.
And PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down so here he is with his friends PGE drinking.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down And then he is here PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Getting the story PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down Something about his PGE wife.
Perhaps PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down talking to somebody else PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down And this leads him to PGE and possibly in drunken state attack his poor wife.
It seems PGB-index-contact-simple-down like PGE yeah he likes going out drinking with his friends.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down No PGE.
I do think some of the pictures are not in sync.
He seems to have PGB-index-contact-complex-down a history of drinking PGE with friends.
No.
Yeah.
Either right before or kind of pattern of behavior out drinking with the boys.
Here he is working or at least farming.
Yeah so this is him at work.
Normal life would be.
PGB-palm-contact-simple-down Working PGE PGB-palm-contact-simple-down having fun PGE PGB-palm-contact-simple-down with his family PGE.
He is PGB-index-contact-simple-down carrying home PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down whatever these PGE they are picking here.
I do not know if PGB-index-contact-simple-down this is his wife or PGE not.
But yeah.
So this is work or just getting food for home.
I do not know.
But again PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical they seem PGE content and happy.
The incident.
He seemed happy.
Oh there you go.
Yeah.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Broken bottle PGE.
He is probably drunk.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down After hearing PGE about PGB-index-nocontact-complex-vertical whatever PGE this gossip is.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down And I think he hit PGE his kid too.
He is a bit of an ass but.
No.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Remorseful drunks he is kind of PGE I do not know woken up to see reality.
About what PGB-index-contact-complex-down he has just PGE done.
Uhm.
Yeah.
Uh.
Yeah.
He is served his time and.
Yeah.
Uhm.
What a happy story.
Next.
Eh.
No.
Well he is PGB-index-contact-complex-down obviously getting PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-vertical beaten PGE in jail.
He is not here thinking about what he has done necessarily.
I would hope he has his.
He is PGB-index-contact-simple-down happy to go PGE back.
So maybe he does have some epiphany in jail.
Yeah so it is obviously not a very nice jail PGB-index-contact-simple-vertical to be in PGE.
Cause normally you do not get beaten by your guards.
At least where we are from.
Hopefully.
Em.
Yeah.
He is suffering PGB-index-nocontact-complex-up and PGE.
I do not see his conscious here.
He is not thinking about his wife.
He is thinking about what is happening to him personally.
Yeah.
Ok.
You are hopeful.
Eh.
This is perhaps then the reformed picture then.
Cause PGB-index-contact-simple-down I believe PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down this is his son PGE.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So kind of changing his ways uhm.
Oh I wanna guess this was his son yeah.
And.
Exactly.
He obviously realizes that alcohol was not for him.
Leads to bad things.
He is and he is trying to make a change in his life.
Poor son PGB-index-contact-simple-down he does not look very impressed PGE here.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down But yeah PGE.
Has he actually PGB-index-contact-simple-down changed or PGE is it just because his son s there.
He definitely is.
Last like he was fairly PGB-index-contact-simple-down young here PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical Still PGE like I am not sure he would he would know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Years have passed.
Hopefully long enough.
Eh.
Yeah.
So I think we are going PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down back now PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Cause it looks like it is the baby again PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down He has the bottle in his hand PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Her father I believe PGE PGB-index-nocontact-complex-vertical is witnessing PGE this as well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Obviously he PGB-palm-contact-complex-down does come PGE.
Well it is not an PGB-index-contact-simple-down excuse obviously PGE.
He has a drink here.
You just gotta wonder why he got angry with her.
PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-vertical They seem to be PGE happy enough otherwise.
It is just.
Well alcohol PGB-index-contact-simple-down explains jealous PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down Talking to him PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down Touching his arm PGE and.
Okay.
Here he is explaining himself then to his wife and son.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical My life sucks PGE.
Yeah.
I do not know PGB-index-contact-simple-down what he is holding PGE here.
Was.
So like PGB-index-contact-complex-down light coming PGE through his window.
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down He is obviously PGE reflects to do.
Yeah.
This PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down is after PGE.
Yeah PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down so from the horror PGE PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-down to more PGE yeah I do not know more reflective mood.
Uh.
Freedom.
Yeah.
So this is the PGB-index-contact-simple-down prison PGE PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-down but he is PGE.
Yeah.
I think PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down this is then the next picture PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Before going home PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down but just kind of just leaving PGE.
PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-down Just between these PGE.
Taking a deep breath.
Fair enough.
Yeah.
Well just like yeah.
I do not know.
This is the fight.
Yeah.
Exactly.
PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-vertical His side of PGE PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down the gossip PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical that he heard and PGE then obviously PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down her PGE.
Do you think this is truthful explanation.
Yep.
And he PGB-index-contact-simple-down is PGE in such a bad state.
He can not.
Be reasonable yeah.
Yeah.
So he is just we will call it miscommunication.
But obviously.
It escalated very quickly.
To drink and uhm.
Well terrified yeah.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Yeah the dad seems pretty PGE.
Look are they PGB-index-contact-simple-down shocked over there PGE.
It is hard to say cause PGB-index-contact-complex-down they are all together PGE.
In the first picture that we have.
I do not know.
Oh it is the last picture.
Ah.
Aha.
I think this is this is his hope.
That when he comes home his son will come and embrace him.
And his wife would be very happy to see him again.
Glad to have him back.
Yeah.
Well cause PGB-index-contact-simple-down it is the PGE process of earning their trust back.
Yeah.
And.
Well the future is very uncertain.
He kind of.
I do not know.
I can not imagine jail is a nice place.
I did not sympathize as little with him but.
On the other hand those are PGB-index-contact-complex-down sad pictures PGE.
One would hope yeah.
I do not get these two pictures cause in jail PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-down a lot of the time is PGE PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down him thinking about himself PGE.
PGB-palm-contact-simple-down Except for the last PGE picture we get.
Which is kind of maybe this is PGB-palm-contact-simple-down the end of PGE.
PGB-palm-nocontact-simple-down He has the anxiety PGE PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-down the fear PGE.
PGB-palm-contact-simple-down Dread PGE and then PGB-index-contact-complex-down they kind of the more PGE.
I do not remember the picture but.
He is kind of having his epiphany perhaps.
So in one of these being more reflective.
Learning that what he did was wrong PGB-palm-contact-simple-up and then PGE.
Kind of PGB-index-nocontact-complex-vertical remembering PGE how beautiful his family is.
I do not know.
How nice PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-up things were PGE before.
And hopefully.
PGB-palm-contact-complex-down We hope PGE he is getting reforming and being a better person.
Happily ever after.
I think we pretty much agreed on the order.
Yeah where PGB-palm-contact-complex-down hey have their PGE kind of life together.
Or maybe this is how they met then.
Since there is no baby.
So maybe they actually work.
Let us try not to get too Disney though on this.
It all starts well and good until.
One of your friends is obviously not a very good friend.
I was wondering whether PGB-index-contact-simple-down this friend PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down actually thinks PGE this is what he saw or whether.
You never know some people are.
I do not know.
Spreading gossip and.
Yeah so he went and confronted his wife.
With his story.
She PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical gave her PGE version of events.
She was just paying obviously.
And he hit her.
Yeah.
Or the child fell when PGB-index-contact-simple-down he hit his.
Cause he obviously hit PGE her very hard.
Yeah.
Anyway.
Domestic abuse here.
He got drunk and say beat up his wife and possibly child.
Trial.
His wife explained what happened and rightfully so he went to jail.
I do not know.
I would guess PGB-palm-contact-simple-down this one happened first PGE.
PGB-palm-nocontact-complex-down Initial traumas PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Then he is PGE kind of well yeah then he kind of he is in a hurt state.
And then and then kind of gets I do not know some it is more reflexive.
As his describes it after yeah.
And eventually he serves his time and gets out.
And clothes.
Enjoys freedom.
Not at all happy to see him.
We can see well we can now see PGB-index-contact-complex-down why they are so happy PGE.
Because PGB-index-contact-simple-down he has his PGE.
Well PGB-palm-contact-simple-down when he was in jail PGE having this hope and this dream that his family will be very happy to see him when obviously.
Yeah.
Aha.
Yeah.
They are giving him perhaps another chance.
And this is where we possibly get to the happily ever after moment.
But I do not know.
It is at least a step.
Yeah.
Hopefully a better man but we will.
Well we do not see but we will hope.
Yeah.
We hope.
Okay.
Do we describe to each other.
Okay.
Team.
Yeah right There are logs underneath the hut.
And some parcels PGB-index-contact-complex-down over here PGE.
Am I describing it as if you can not see it.
Okay.
Okay.
Uhm it looks like the guy PGB-other-contact-simple-down who is coming PGE has his arms out.
So it looks like he is maybe saying hi to everyone.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down He has got a backpack PGE on so maybe he has been away and he is coming back.
Yeah.
Yeah it is only the guy that is coming that has a he has a smile on his face.
The others are just kind of watching him come.
Done.
Okay looks like it is in maybe like a police station.
Or.
Yeah.
So there is two guys.
One is wearing a uniform.
And the other guy is wearing just normal clothes.
And they are both holding together.
Though maybe one has passed something to the other.
A parcel of clothes and shoes.
PGB-other-contact-simple-down There is a speech bubble here PGE from the policeman.
Well the guy in uniform that has in the speech bubble a shirt and shorts and shoes.
Or he is probably saying something to the other guy about the clothes that he is passing over.
Something like that.
And the building looks like it might be in Asia.
I think.
It does not look like Germany.
PGB-other-contact-simple-down The bamboo door PGE and the kind of PGB-other-contact-simple-down no door on this door frame PGE.
Oh yeah.
And he is all hunched up.
Like he like you would do if you are cold or sad.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical The window is super small PGE.
Yes.
Four PGB-index-contact-complex-up guys maybe sitting around.
One has an open bottle of something.
Drink.
Another bottle on the ground.
They all look cross.
One guy is speaking PGE PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down to the other guy PGE.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down And in the speech bubble PGE there is a guy and a girl.
So PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down maybe he PGE PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down is saying something PGE about PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down the girl PGE to the other guy.
And they all look very cross.
Yeah.
They all PGB-index-contact-simple-down yeah PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down they all have got drinks PGE.
Ajaj.
Okay.
There is PGB-index-contact-complex-down how many five people sitting around.
Three are at a table PGE.
One looks like one is wearing a uniform.
And the two other people look like they are making notes on paper.
And there is two extra people.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down One sitting on a stool PGE at the side.
Who is kind of hunched over and has their head in their face.
And has a a ball and chain around his ankle.
And PGB-index-contact-simple-down this one PGE.
Yeah PGB-index-contact-complex-down and in the picture it PGE shows the man punching the woman.
Okay in this one.
And PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down the baby the PGE PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down kid is reaching down PGE for another coconut.
Maybe they have been collecting coconuts.
uhm in this one there is a bunch of people probably all guys sitting around drinking.
There is sorts of bottle on the ground and in the peoples hands.
uhm two are sitting on a bench.
The rest are probably sitting on the ground.
uhm they look relaxed and happy.
This they have sort of relaxed or smiling faces.
They are probably just talking and drinking.
uhm.
These do not look like coconuts.
Pumpkins or something.
Yeah they are both bending down on the ground.
Each touching one of the gourds and one hand on the vegetation.
So maybe they are pulling them off or something.
Yeah.
uhm in PGB-other-nocontact-complex-down this one there is the woman PGE.
PGB-other-contact-simple-down And she is crouched down on the ground PGE holding her face.
And it looks like it is been injured.
And she has her baby in front of her.
Who also maybe looks injured.
And the two people in uniform are dragging away a man who.
Who is in handcuffs.
And looks very worried.
Yep.
So this guy.
Maybe the same guy is.
It is a close up on him his face.
And he is got his head in his hands.
And he is got handcuffs on.
And there is two thought bubbles.
One where he is being beaten by someone in the uniform.
And the other one where he is looking out through prison bars and looking very sad or upset in all the pictures.
Oh yeah.
Uh.
Yeah there is two people who have drinks and they are sort of giving or offering it to him.
And he is walking past.
And there is.
And he is saying no I do not want any.
Oh yeah.
He has got his arms.
Boy has got his arms crossed.
uhm in this picture there is a man and a woman.
And the man is punching the woman in the face.
The woman is holding a baby.
And the man is holding a drink.
Bottle.
uhm and in the background there is an old man who is.
Well a man.
He is got a white beard and uhm holding a cane.
And he is looking shocked.
He is got his hand up to his face.
And his mouth open like he is shocked.
PGB-other-contact-simple-vertical And the guy PGE who is punching looks angry.
And the baby is almost falling out.
This.
Yeah one of them is just him sitting in jail.
Or someone sitting in jail.
Yeah.
I wonder PGB-index-contact-simple-down if he could be praying in that one PGE.
PGB-index-contact-simple-vertical And it looks like PGE he has calm or some sense of peace or something.
And the woman is PGB-other-nocontact-simple-vertical listening.
She has her mouth opened slightly PGE.
PGB-other-nocontact-simple-vertical She does not look PGE cross.
No.
She is just listening.
PGB-other-nocontact-simple-vertical The child PGE looks.
I do not know.
Maybe sad maybe just listening.
Okay.
So in this picture the guy is standing with his hands on his hips.
And he has a bag on.
And he is looking up into the sky.
With the smile on his face.
He looks healthy though.
For someone just coming out of jail.
Okay.
Yeah but PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down they look in good condition PGE.
Like new clothes.
Oh yeah.
Yeah the guy the husband looks like he is ready to punch.
He has got a closed fist.
Yeah.
Drink in the other hand.
The woman and the PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down child look scared PGE as well.
uhm I think it looks like he is in jail.
And he is imagining from the though bubble going PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down home.
And being PGE re-united PGB-index-contact-simple-down with his son PGE PGB-index-contact-simple-down and PGE wife.
Who both look happy to see him.
They are coming out of the house to meet him. 
PGB-index-nocontact-complex-down And the son is running PGE to him with open arms.
Should we pull all the prison ones together.
This is the rest.
There.
Here the boy is big
In prison.
Is this gonna be after or.
And this PGB-index-contact-complex-down is when they PGE.
PGB-index-contact-complex-down That would be before the PGE trial.
Yeah.
This is going into prison.
This one over here.
This is wait that is in prison right.
Oh wait this is when he is imagining did not you say.
Yeah.
Here.
Thinking.
PGB-index-contact-simple-down Yeah PGE.
Yeah.
He goes and gets a drink.
He is upset.
Okay.
So uhm there is a boy somewhere in what looks like Polynesia or South East Asia approaching an old man who is sitting on a platform in a hut.
And there is a boy holding a bucket.
And a woman standing by holding bananas.
The woman looks a bit annoyed.
And the boy with the bucket looks sad.
And the old man looks indifferent.
You can go first this time.
Yeah.
So it looks like the man not in the uniform is possibly in trouble.
And he is going to go to jail.
And he has been asked to hand over his clothes to the official and he is gonna be put in the cell.
Okay so the same man from the previous picture is clearly in jail in a cell.
And he is sitting in the corner.
And there is a bit of light coming out of the window.
That is illuminating that corner.
And next to him is a plate with maybe some bread on it.
Looks like maybe the man who is talking is telling the other angry man that his girlfriend has been flirting with someone else.
Possibly even him.
And this is making the other guy angry.
So it looks like the there is a woman who is a victim of violence.
And that she is giving testimony before the court.
And that the person who is alleged to have hit her is the one sitting on the stool with an iron chain around his leg.
And she is got injuries on her face.
And she is talking about what happened.
So it is the same man and woman and everyone is happy.
And they are walking along.
And he is carrying a basket which could be filled with fresh coconuts.
And she is got three like young coconuts.
And they have got a child which is presumably their child.
And he is holding the woman by the hand.
And they are walking along the path and approaching someone who is selling fruit from a basket.
Yeah that is what is happening.
No.
Yeah so in this picture the same kind of protagonist and his partner are doing something with gourds.
They could be gourds.
Coconuts.
In any case either they are picking them or they are.
It looks like they are picking gourds.
So they are taking the vegetation of the side.
Yeah pulling it.
Yeah and his beer is smashed on the ground.
And his partner is not facing him as he is being dragged away.
And it looks like he is outdoors in the court area at the moment.
So maybe he is wondering what is gonna become of him if he is gonna get in the first bubble.
Whether he is gonna get beaten in jail.
Or PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical whether he is PGE gonna stay in jail.
Or what is gonna happen.
Me.
So the same guy is wandering alone past the area where people are drinking.
And he is refusing.
He is saying I do not wanna I do not wanna drink anymore.
there is a boy who is looking at him observing what is going on.
Also walking in the same direction as him.
So maybe his son grown up.
Uhhuh.
uhm yeah so that is what is happening.
Uh.
So the same man is sitting down with perhaps his wife and son.
And he is recounting.
From the speech bubbles he is recounting what is happened to him in jail.
It is hard to see what might have happened to him in jail.
Maybe the next one is him feeling contrite.
And wanting to reform or something.
Oh yeah maybe.
Yeah.
She does not look upset.
Okay.
Or should I go first.
So perhaps he is just come out of jail.
And he is feeling very happy to be outside for the first time in a long time.
Yeah but he got his he got his clothes back so.
uhm is it me.
I do not know.
Anyway.
uhm so now in this picture the man is talking to his wife.
Who is holding the child.
And he seems to be saying I have heard that you were flirting with another man.
And she is saying no I was actually buying something from him.
You have got it wrong.
And the old man is in the background looking on observing.
And he is very angry and she looks very worried and so does the child.
Uhhuh.
PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down And he is got PGE a drink in his hand.
Yeah.
Uhm.
That is all.
Let is okay that can be the prison part.
And this can be out-of-prison story.
And this is the before prison story.
Yeah.
This is after here at the end maybe.
Yeah.
Now before prison.
That would go there.
This is the return.
That will be before they.
I recon there.
The happy times.
And then that is the trial.
I recon.
That is so they are here.
And they are having a conversation.
That would there.
Yeah.
This is out of prison.
Yeah he would be probably there.
And then he is PGB-index-nocontact-simple-vertical convicted.
He goes PGE to jail.
And then he is thinking.
But there was another one where he has two speech bubbles.
Oh PGB-index-nocontact-simple-down no that is him PGE the the court.
Okay.
And then he is out again.
And it is not quite the happy reunion that he was hoping for.
Then he reconciles.
And then he is decides not to do that again.
So if you recon.
PGB-palm-contact-complex-down So they are gathering PGE PGB-index-contact-complex-down walking back PGE.
PGB-palm-contact-simple-down There PGE.
